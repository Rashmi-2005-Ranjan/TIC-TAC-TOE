# TIC-TAC-TOE
This project is a simple yet classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to alternate turns, placing either "X" or "O" on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of your symbols in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before your opponent.
